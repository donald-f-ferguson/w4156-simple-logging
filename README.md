# Simple FastAPI Logging Example

The starting source for this example is [FastAPI logging](https://philstories.medium.com/fastapi-logging-f6237b84ea64).

There are some minor modifications but no significant changes.

The files are:
- [main.py](main.py) is the application and router.
- [logging.conf](logging.conf) contains the configuration information for the Python
logging framework.
- [uicheckapp](uicheckapp) is the world's simplest set of REST resources. There is one file,
[services.ps](uicheckapp/services.py) that contains a single service.
